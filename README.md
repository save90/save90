- 👋 Hi, I’m @save90, an italian beginner developer with the foundation of web development (HTML, CSS,Javascript).
- 👀 I’m totally going crazy for the open source and its potentiality.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, API management but I'd like to learn also the back-end side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some open source project as super-beginner collaborator.
